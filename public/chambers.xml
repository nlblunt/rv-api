		<shortDescription>Located in Crescent City, the Redwood Forest has some of the oldest living trees in the world.</shortDescription>
		<longDescription>Crescent City is home to Redwood National and State Parks and the Sequoia Semperviren, or tallest trees on Earth. Once covering most of the land of North America, these trees are now only found in a narrow area along the northern California coast, where they tower over the landscape, growing 350 feet tall, and thousands of acres of old-growth forest have yet to be seen by humans. But Crescent City is home to so much more. Discover the Smith River, a Wild and Scenic River offering crystal clear emerald waters and record-setting salmon, two historic lighthouses, one the site of a shipwreck carrying millions in dollars of gold bars, and growing populations of majestic Roosevelt Elk.</longDescription>

		<shortDescription>Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.</shortDescription>
		<longDescription>Best known for one of the oldest-designated national parks, Tuolumne County is home to Yosemite National Park, encompassing 1,200 square miles in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Much waits to be discovered here. But Yosemite is most famous for it glacier-carved granite valley filled with breathless waterfalls and artistic granite formations. The largest trees in the world, the Giant Sequoia, can be found within its boundaries, as is the tallest waterfall in the continental US, Yosemite Falls, with a vertical drop of nearly half a mile. It is a rock-climbing paradise, as mountaineers seek to ascend vertical peaks like El Capitan and Half Dome. It is a shrine to those who thought to preserve this beautiful destination for a multitude of generations to come. Tuolumne County is also known for its authentic Gold Rush towns (with active gold discoveries still taking place), its world-renowned Class 4 river rapids, and its remote high-country hiking as both the Pacific Crest Trail and the John Muir Trail wander through this area.</longDescription>

		<shortDescription>Gold Beach has more sunny days than anywhere else on the coast</shortDescription>
		<longDescription>Gold Beach is located on the southern Oregon coast, in the heart of America’s Wild Rivers Coast, just 37 miles north of the California border. Discover why it’s often referred to as a “banana belt”, with a year-round climate that is more temperate than anywhere else on the Northwest Pacific coast. Gold Beach is also where the clear waters of the Rogue River meets the majestic Pacific Ocean. Beautiful trees, mountains, rivers, beaches and the ocean define its landscape. Summers offer pleasant temperatures of 65 to 70 degrees, sunny days, and beautiful evening skies for stargazing. During the fall and spring, look for migrating Grey whales, and fish for salmon or steelhead when the runs begin. Windsurf, walk the beaches or take a jet boat ride upriver through pristine wilderness to glimpse at bald eagles, bear or river otter. Local business owners are ready to make your stay enjoyable and memorable.</longDescription>

		<shortDescription>Marianna Jackson County offers an array of things to do, even in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael. Experience the “new normal” for Marianna, as visitors are encouraged to discover hidden secrets as they learn how Marianna is re-building about almost  200 years of Jackson County history.</shortDescription>
		<longDescription>On October 10, 2018, Jackson County experienced the unimaginable when Hurricane Michael made landfall as a historic Category 5 hurricane.  The devastation was felt far and wide, and a year later, the community is still recovering. Progress has been slow, but it has been made.  Many of the locally-owned businesses have reopened to the public. Its restaurants are back to serving the public, and its natural assets are being cleaned up, but it will likely never be the same. That doesn’t mean visitors won’t be able to enjoy them just as much. Three Rivers State Park has reopened for day use, the Chipola River and Spring Creek have been cleared of debris for boaters and floaters, Merritt’s Mill Pond has been welcoming back guests for paddling, fishing, and cave diving, and Lake Seminole, the Chattahoochee River, and the Apalachicola River are still fishing hotspots for anglers. But hiking and biking trails are facing a different story.  With the powerful winds came destruction to the forests.  Not a single trail was spared in Jackson County, and with most of them on state and federal lands, clean-up efforts will take time. This changing landscape, though, brings new opportunities. Instead of hiking a trail, take a scenic drive to explore the Spanish Heritage Trail. Discover local farms on the AgriTourism Trail.  Stop in and shop at any of the local stores and boutiques, or grab a bite to eat at one of Marianna’s delicious restaurants.  Explore the history of Jackson County along the new Historic Marker Trail. There are so many unique opportunities in Jackson County, you’re sure to find something new to experience..And as time progresses, progress will continue with new openings, events, and things to do.  The chamber welcomes you into Jackson County and encourages you to explore its “New Normal”, while supporting the rebuilding of a community. </longDescription>
